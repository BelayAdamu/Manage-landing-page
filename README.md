## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- regExpressions
- fontawesome


### What I learned

In this project I practiced my Flexbox layout, regExpression, transitions and responsive design skills.

### Continued development

This is my first challange in which I practiced my js skills. the project involved very little js coding and I'm a bit dissapointed at that.
